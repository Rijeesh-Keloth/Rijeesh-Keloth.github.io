							<p>My past research work has mainly focused on experimental studies on neutrino properties, 
								this includes measuring the neutrino oscillation parameters and searching for the 
								fourth type neutrino, the sterile neutrino. Although the Standard Model of particle physics
								has proved to be a remarkably resilient theory, we know that it does not give a complete description
								of the observable universe. For my dissertation work, I have been testing models which describe the physics 
								beyond the standard model. In the next step of my research career, I would like to gain experience in designing
								precision experiments to test our knowledge of the universe, to extend the present knowledge and make new discoveries.

								<h3>Experimental Neutrino  Physics</h3>
								<p> The next few years are pivotal with a range of experiments
									being conceived to improve the under- standing and make new discoveries. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
									Working on the future neutrino experiment would be an ideal opportunity to make my contribution. 
									I am more excited than ever to put my skills to any present or future experiment and help the field 
									strive to reach a better understanding of the laws of nature. During my time at Fermilab, as a member 
									in one of the world leading long-baseline neutrino experiments, I became aware of the exciting neutrino physics programs at the Lab and 
									I would love the opportunity to expand my horizon in this area. The neutrino sector is one of the aspects 
									of the Standard Model (SM) and Beyond Standard Model (BSM) where there are still many unanswered questions and puzzles.
									
									Standard three-flavor neutrino oscillations have been well explained by a wide range of neutrino ex- periments. 
									But there are anomalous results, such as electron-antineutrino excesses seen by LSND and MiniBooNE which do not 
									fit the three-flavor paradigm. This can possibly be explained by an addi- tional fourth sterile neutrino at a 
									larger mass scale than the existing three flavor neutrinos. The NOvA experiment at Fermilab consists of two 
									finely segmented, liquid scintillator detectors, a near and a far detector, operating 14.6 mrad off-axis from 
									the Neutrinos at Main Injector (NuMI) muon-neutrino beam. The Near Detector is located on the Fermilab campus, 
									1 km from the NuMI target, while the Far Detector is located at Ash River, MN, 810 km from the NuMI target. 
									The NOvA experiment is primarily designed to measure electron-neutrino appearance at the Far Detector using 
									the Near Detec- tor to control systematic uncertainties; however, the Near Detector with L/E in the range 0.1 -1 
									is well suited for searching for anomalous short-baseline oscillations.My PhD research is on the NOvA experiment 
									where I performed a search for anomalous τ neutrino appearance due to sterile neutrino oscillations in the NOvA Near
									Detector. This was the first time this search has been performed at NOvA. I performed the full analysis which includes,
									developing particle identifiers for the hadronic decay mode of ντ Charged Current interactions, optimizing the signal
									event selection for maximum background rejection and detailed systematic studies for this first analysis of its type. 
									As mentioned before, NOvA is located 14.6 mrad off-axis to NuMI beam axis, where the beam energy peaks at 2 GeV, with 
									neutrinos mainly coming from pions. The NOvA beam has also a second energy peak in which neutrinos are mainly coming 
									from kaons, whose energy is greater than the τ production threshold. I used these high energy neutrinos for this analysis.
									The main challenge of this analysis comes from the identification of high energy ντ Charged Current (CC) signal from a
									huge νμ, νe CC and Neutral Current background in the detector. It is not practically possible to identify the τ particle 
									directly since the spatial and time resolution of the detector is much larger than the τ decay length. However, it is
									possible to identify the τ decay products in the detector. The other challenge is to optimize the sensitivity when 
									including the huge systematic uncertainty arising from various detector and simulation effects.
									
									This work has been presented in major international conferences like Neutrino ‘16 (London, 2016 - poster), 
									International Neutrino Summer School (Fermilab, 2017 - received 2-nd place poster award), Neutrino ‘18 (Germany, 2018 - 
									poster), April Meeting of American Physical Society (Washington DC, January 2016 - talk) and Meeting of Division of Particles 
									and Fields of American Physical Society (Fermilab, April 2017 - poster).
									
									I am an expert in monte-carlo production in NOvA. I have made a significant contributions to the pro- duction 
									of data files corresponding to 8×1020 POT needed for the various analyses in NOvA including 2016 and 2017 νe appearance, 
									νμ disappearance and 2017 Neutral Current disappearance analyses.
									In addition to this research work I have also had the opportunity to participate in hardware projects.
									I have a significant contribution in the quality analysis of the avalanche photodiodes (APDs) used for 
									the replacement of malfunctioning APDs. I am a trained expert in the replacement of malfunctioning electronics
									on the detector. Additionally I participated in the operation of the experiment by taking control room shifts.</span></p>

								<h3>Teaching</h3>
								<p>     I have been fortunate enough to be a teaching fellow 
									in a number of courses at the Malabar Christian College. <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"> In each of these courses, the institution/professor offered
									me a great chance to lead sessions in addition to holding office hours, constructing exams, and grading papers.
									I have also had the opportunity to be a co-instructor in three courses: Mathematical Physics, Quantum Mechanics, 
									Electrodynamics and Electronics. Each course presented a wonderful opportunity to learn and to grow myself as a teacher.
									I co-taught Mathematical Physics with another professor at CUSAT for 1st semester M.Sc Physics course in 2014.
									I learnt a great deal about tailoring the pace and content of the material to the expertise and interests of the students, 
									which was an exciting challenge given the diversity of the class.
									During this period, I learnt how to make mathematical physics appealing to the students 
									with respect to the utility of the topic.
									I was also given the opportunity to be the supervisory guide of 3rd year B.Sc. students at
									Malabar Christian College (MCC), Calicut during the academic year 2011-12. During my tenure at MCC, 
									I worked with over 35 undergraduates as a project mentor and closely advised three students on their final year projects.
									I was honored by the students for giving special lectures in students association inauguration at the college.

									My desire to engage, challenge, 
									and inspire growth in students is not limited to the classroom. 
									That is, I strive to become a skilled thinker and learner, and I 
									believe that this process is life-long. Finally, it is critical to note that classes and 
									workshops that feature pedagogical issues are a priority to me, and I hope to continue
									taking courses similar to those 
									I have had at CUSAT and MCC, but certainly along with the experimental particle physics
									courses in future. </span></p>
