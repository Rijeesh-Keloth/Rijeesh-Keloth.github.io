							<p>My past research work has mainly focused on experimental studies on neutrino properties, 
								this includes measuring the neutrino oscillation parameters and searching for the 
								fourth type neutrino, the sterile neutrino. Although the Standard Model of particle physics
								has proved to be a remarkably resilient theory, we know that it does not give a complete description
								of the observable universe. For my dissertation work, I have been testing models which describe the physics 
								beyond the standard model. In the next step of my research career, I would like to gain experience in designing
								precision experiments to test our knowledge of the universe, to extend the present knowledge and make new discoveries.

								<h3>Teaching</h3>
								<p>     I have been fortunate enough to be a teaching fellow 
									in a number of courses at the Malabar Christian College. <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"> In each of these courses, the institution/professor offered
									me a great chance to lead sessions in addition to holding office hours, constructing exams, and grading papers.
									I have also had the opportunity to be a co-instructor in three courses: Mathematical Physics, Quantum Mechanics, 
									Electrodynamics and Electronics. Each course presented a wonderful opportunity to learn and to grow myself as a teacher.
									I co-taught Mathematical Physics with another professor at CUSAT for 1st semester M.Sc Physics course in 2014.
									I learnt a great deal about tailoring the pace and content of the material to the expertise and interests of the students, 
									which was an exciting challenge given the diversity of the class.
									During this period, I learnt how to make mathematical physics appealing to the students 
									with respect to the utility of the topic.
									I was also given the opportunity to be the supervisory guide of 3rd year B.Sc. students at
									Malabar Christian College (MCC), Calicut during the academic year 2011-12. During my tenure at MCC, 
									I worked with over 35 undergraduates as a project mentor and closely advised three students on their final year projects.
									I was honored by the students for giving special lectures in students association inauguration at the college.

									My desire to engage, challenge, 
									and inspire growth in students is not limited to the classroom. 
									That is, I strive to become a skilled thinker and learner, and I 
									believe that this process is life-long. Finally, it is critical to note that classes and 
									workshops that feature pedagogical issues are a priority to me, and I hope to continue
									taking courses similar to those 
									I have had at CUSAT and MCC, but certainly along with the experimental particle physics
									courses in future. </span></p>
