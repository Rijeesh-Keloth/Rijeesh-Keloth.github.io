						<h2>Teaching Physics</h2>

					</header>
<p>
I have been fortunate enough to be a teaching fellow in a number of courses at the Malabar Christian College. In each of these courses, the institution/professor offered me a great chance to lead sessions in addition to holding office hours, constructing exams, and grading papers. I have also had the opportunity to be a co-instructor in three courses: Mathematical Physics, Quantum Mechanics, Electrodynamics and Electronics. Each course presented a wonderful opportunity to learn and to grow myself as a teacher. I co-taught Mathematical Physics with another professor at CUSAT for 1st semester M.Sc Physics course in 2014. I learnt a great deal about tailoring the pace and content of the material to the expertise and interests of the students, which was an exciting challenge given the diversity of the class. During this period, I learnt how to make mathematical physics appealing to the students with respect to the utility of the topic. I was also given the opportunity to be the supervisory guide of 3rd year B.Sc. students at Malabar Christian College (MCC), Calicut during the academic year 2011-12. During my tenure at MCC, I worked with over 35 undergraduates as a project mentor and closely advised three students on their final year projects. I was honored by the students for giving special lectures in students association inauguration at the college. My desire to engage, challenge, and inspire growth in students is not limited to the classroom. That is, I strive to become a skilled thinker and learner, and I believe that this process is life-long. Finally, it is critical to note that classes and workshops that feature pedagogical issues are a priority to me, and I hope to continue taking courses similar to those I have had at CUSAT and MCC, but certainly along with the experimental particle physics courses in future.
